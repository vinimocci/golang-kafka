# golang-kafka
Simple Kafka integration within a Golang application

# USAGE

This application runs with Docker Compose to create containers and initialize the Kafka server. So, it is assumed that you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. Beyond that, you'll need Golang installed too. Knowing that, this is how you get to run the app:

- Enter on the root folder and run docker-compose up -d;
- Use the docker ps command to see if the Zookeeper and Kafka containers are running;
